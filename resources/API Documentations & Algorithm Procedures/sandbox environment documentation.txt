Tracxn API Sandbox is a free and fully-featured environment that allows you to safely test prototypes and integrations.

The sandbox environment gives you access to the Cybersecurity feed and all the companies, funding rounds, acquistions, investors, sectors (Practice Area/Feed/Business Models) under it.

APIs in the Sandbox environment match those in production - all filters, sorts are supported and it returns the same API response, making it easy to move into the production phase.

After the testing/integration is complete, you only need to change the endpoint URL from the sandbox to Production endpoint:
eg. For Companies API, change from https://tracxn.com/api/2.2/sandbox/companies/ to https://tracxn.com/api/2.2/companies/

__The Sandbox API__

EndPoint : eg. https://tracxn.com/api/2.2/sandbox/companies, https://tracxn.com/api/2.2/sandbox/investors etc
Token:	<same token for Sandbox and Production provided by tracxn>
Filters: All filters are applied on Companies, Transactions etc which are tagged to Cybersecurity feed. eg. Passing company funding filter "totalMoneyRaised": {"min":2000000, "max":20000000} (with no feedName filter) will return all Companies/Transactions/Acquisitions under Cybersecurity feed that have raised funding between $2M and $20M. eg. Passing sector filter "feedName": ["HRTech"] will return all Companies/Transactions/Investors etc under Cybersecurity feed that are also tagged to "HRTech" feed.


__Rate Limiting__
In order to protect our servers from being overloaded and to ensure high quality service to all our customers, Tracxn limits the number of API calls made by a user.
All rate limits are on a per-user basis.
The following are the per user limits for different time periods:
1. 1000 API calls per hour
2. 10,000 API calls per day
Note: These limits are subject to change without notice. They will however be updated in this documentation.
Exceeding the rate limit will cause an HTTP 429 error "Too Many Requests". Your app should respond by spacing out consecutive requests.
